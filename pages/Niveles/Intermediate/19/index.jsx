          I live in an apartment. In my city, there is a post office where people mail letters. <br /> On Monday, I go to work. I work at the post office. Everyone shops for food at the grocery store. They also eat at the restaurant. <br /> The restaurant serves pizza and ice cream.
          My friends and I go to the park. <br /> We like to play soccer at the park. On Fridays, we go to the cinema to see a movie. Children don't go to school on the weekend. Each day, people go to the hospital when they are sick. <br /> The doctors and nurses take care of them. The police keep everyone safe. I am happy to live in my city.</p>
